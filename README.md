This readme is for the team to be able to communicate.

# PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU CHANGE ANYTHING

[This](https://github.com/AlexGithub777/Goku-Black) repo is from the students at the other EIT. Ours should look similar.

## Differences
- Our group meeting reports are .md as per requirements
- We have a wiki and readme.

 # To do

- Zoe: Web pages aren't displaying properly, can you fix it please, as we can't access the settings? thanks.
- Cairo to complete the UAT and upload file as .md onto GitHub.
