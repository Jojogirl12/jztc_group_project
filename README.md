# PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU CHANGE ANYTHING
[This](https://github.com/AlexGithub777/Goku-Black) repo is from the students at the other EIT. Ours should look similar.
## Differences
- Our group meeting reports are .md as per requirements, they didn't do it.
- We have a wiki while they don't.

# Finished
- I've change the md code stuff so its easier to understand and change. It looks even better.
- The links in the wiki work now.
  
# To do
- Gantt chart for iteration 3, this should outline everything.
- Zoe: Web pages aren't displaying properly, can you fix it please, as we can't access the settings? thanks.
- Zoe: We need a kanban board please
