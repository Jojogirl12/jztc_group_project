## Group Reflection
### Key learnings: 
- Clear and open communication within the team is vital to getting the work done.
### Challenges faced: 
- The first meeting was challenging, the group was unfamiliar with one another and the assessment requirements. However, in the meetings to follow, communication improved, and some progress was made. 
- Team members who were not available or present made collaboration difficult.
### Achievements: 
- As a team, we all contributed towards completing agile tasks for iteration 1 of the assessment
### Plans on improvement for Iteration 2:
- Everyone must have a clear understanding of the assessment and our objectives. 

- We must work towards becoming better team players by communicating, cooperating, and participating equally. Work together, share ideas and help each other out.

- Make sure to edit work before submitting. Each team member is responsible for spelling and punctuation check.

## Individual Contributions

### Joenella 
~~~md
- As the Project Manager, I was responsible for the team meetings, work being delegated, requirements being met and meeting deadlines. I can support this by being present at every meeting, communicating face-to-face, email and chat. 

- Project Manager tasks included:
- Filling out own section of the stakeholder register
- Creating a persona (Tracey Jones).
- I contributed to the testing of the two other personas also. (See Reply on Persona discussion on myEIT).
- Creating the Progress Report so that each member can contribute towards the group reflection and their own contributions.
